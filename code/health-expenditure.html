        This section explores how much each country invests in hospital care as
        a percentage of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP), based on OECD data
        from 2016.

        <h3>Analysis of Hospital Expenditure by Country (2016)</h3>
        <p>
          This bar chart visualizes the
          <strong
            >percentage of GDP that 34 countries allocated to hospital services
            in 2016</strong
          >. <strong>Denmark leads</strong> the group at
          <strong>4.689%</strong>, followed closely by
          <strong>Japan, Greece, and Australia</strong>—all exceeding
          <strong>3.6%</strong>. At the other end of the scale, countries such
          as the <strong>United Kingdom (1.162%)</strong>,
          <strong>Luxembourg (1.327%)</strong>, and
          <strong>Sweden (1.342%)</strong>
          allocated relatively little to hospital expenditure.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a public health policy perspective, this distribution raises
          important questions about the
          <strong>prioritisation of healthcare within national budgets</strong>.
          While GDP percentages do not capture the full complexity of a nation’s
          health system, they do reflect
          <strong>government and system-level commitment</strong> to
          <strong>hospital infrastructure and services</strong>—a critical
          pillar of public health capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, several
          <strong
            >high-income countries with advanced healthcare systems</strong
          >
          (e.g. <strong>Germany, France, Canada</strong>) still fall below
          <strong>3.5% of GDP in hospital spending</strong>. This suggests that
          even among OECD nations,
          <strong>investment in hospital services varies considerably</strong>
          despite similar economic capacities.
        </p>
        <p>
          For researchers and policymakers advocating for
          <strong>increased public health funding</strong>, this visualisation
          serves as a <strong>compelling starting point</strong>. It highlights
          <strong>significant disparities</strong> and invites deeper
          exploration of the relationship between
          <strong>hospital spending and health outcomes</strong> (e.g. life
          expectancy, avoidable mortality, or patient satisfaction). As
          additional datasets are incorporated into this project—such as
          <strong>perceived health status</strong>,
          <strong>healthcare access equity</strong>, and
          <strong>preventative care spending</strong>—we aim to show that
          nations investing more consistently in health tend to achieve
          <strong>better public health outcomes</strong>.

        <h3>Analysis of Hospital Expenditure by Country (2021)</h3>
        <p>
          This chart shows the
          <strong>hospital expenditure as a percentage of GDP</strong> across
          countries in 2021. Compared to 2016, most nations experienced an
          increase in hospital spending—likely influenced by the
          <strong>global COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, which placed unprecedented
          pressure on healthcare systems. Notably, countries such as
          <strong>Portugal (from 3.545% to 4.246%)</strong>,
          <strong>Cyprus (2.338% to 4.448%)</strong>, and
          <strong>Spain (3.432% to 4.213%)</strong> saw significant increases,
          indicating a ramp-up in public health investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some high-income nations also increased spending:
          <strong>France</strong> (3.49% → 3.695%),
          <strong>Germany</strong> (2.866% → 3.114%), and
          <strong>Australia</strong> (3.648% → 3.726%). However, the rate of
          increase varied. For instance, <strong>Canada</strong> slightly
          <em>decreased</em> its hospital spending (2.577% → 2.437%), possibly
          due to shifts in how care was delivered (e.g. more outpatient or
          community-based services).
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite economic growth, some countries like
          <strong>Sweden</strong> (1.342% → 1.309%) and the
          <strong>UK</strong> (1.162% → 1.412%) remained relatively low in terms
          of hospital-related spending as a share of GDP. These patterns may
          reflect ongoing
          <strong>efficiency strategies, different health system models</strong
          >, or evolving <strong>policy priorities</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The comparison suggests that external shocks like pandemics can
          significantly reshape national health spending. It also highlights how
          different countries
          <strong>adapt their investment strategies</strong> in hospital care,
          which may have long-term implications for
          <strong
            >health system resilience, preparedness, and population
            outcomes</strong
          >.

        <h3>Analysis of Hospital Expenditure Trends by Country (2016–2023)</h3>
        <p>
          This interactive line chart illustrates trends in hospital expenditure
          as a percentage of GDP across OECD countries from
          <strong>2016 to 2023</strong>. While most countries show a
          <strong>notable increase in 2020 and 2021</strong>, likely reflecting
          the <strong>impact of the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, the trends vary
          significantly across nations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, <strong>Denmark</strong>, <strong>Cyprus</strong>, and
          <strong>Portugal</strong> consistently allocate more than
          <strong>4% of GDP</strong> to hospital services in recent years,
          indicating sustained investment in hospital infrastructure. In
          contrast, countries such as <strong>Israel</strong>,
          <strong>Luxembourg</strong>, and the
          <strong>United Kingdom</strong> maintain relatively low hospital
          expenditure, generally under <strong>1.6% of GDP</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that
          <strong>not all countries have reported data through to 2023</strong>.
          While most countries provided data up to <strong>2022</strong>, only a
          limited number have published figures for <strong>2023</strong> at the
          time of writing. As such, comparisons beyond 2021 should be made with
          caution.
        </p>
        <p>
          These spending patterns highlight how healthcare priorities differ
          internationally and prompt further questions about the
          <strong
            >relationship between expenditure levels and public health
            outcomes</strong
          >, particularly in times of crisis. The chart enables users to explore
          individual country trajectories over time, offering insights into both
          <strong>long-term strategies</strong> and
          <strong>short-term responses</strong> in national healthcare
          investment.

      <section class="analysis">
        <p>
          This chart displays the average annual hospital expenditure as a
          percentage of GDP across all reporting OECD countries from 2016 to
          2023. It highlights a distinct increase in spending during 2020 and
          2021, which coincides with the global COVID-19 pandemic. The average
          rose sharply in 2020 as many countries boosted health budgets in
          response to public health emergencies, then remained elevated through
          2021. In 2022 and 2023, the average begins to level out or slightly
          decline, though this should be interpreted with caution—data
          availability drops significantly in the final two years, with most
          countries reporting only up to 2022 and relatively few providing
          figures for 2023. Despite this limitation, the trend provides useful
          context for understanding how health expenditure evolved globally
          during and after the pandemic years.
