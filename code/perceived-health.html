      <h1>Perceived Health Status by Income Quintile</h1>

      <p>
        This section visualises how citizens rate their own health over time,
        split by income groups. The dataset spans 2016–2023 and highlights
        health disparities based on socio-economic status.

        <h3>Analysis of Perceived Health Status Over Time</h3>
        <p>
          This line chart tracks the percentage of people in selected countries
          who report being in
          <em>“good” or “very good” health</em>, broken down by income quintile
          (Q1 = lowest 20%, Q5 = highest 20%) over multiple years.
        </p>
        <p>
          A clear trend is visible across almost all countries:
          <strong
            >perceived health status dropped noticeably during the COVID-19
            pandemic years (2020–2022)</strong
          >. This decline affected both lower- and higher-income groups, but
          often more sharply among those in the lowest income quintile. The data
          highlights how health crises can
          <strong>widen socio-economic disparities in well-being</strong>, even
          in high-income nations.
        </p>
        <p>
          One particularly striking case is <strong>Japan</strong>, where
          perceived health status is significantly lower than in other countries
          — for both low- and high-income groups. Even among Japan’s wealthiest
          20%, fewer than 45% report being in good or very good health in recent
          years. In contrast, high-income groups in other countries typically
          report rates between 70% and 95%. This may reflect
          <strong>Japan’s much older population</strong>, as older individuals
          may be more likely to report lower perceived health, even when
          objective health indicators like life expectancy remain high.
        </p>
        <p>
          These patterns suggest that
          <strong
            >income and age demographics both strongly influence how people
            perceive their own health</strong
          >
          — and that public health investments should consider not just clinical
          outcomes, but also how people feel about their health, especially
          during periods of crisis.
