      <h1>Perceived Health Status by Income Quintile</h1>

      <p>
        This section visualises how citizens rate their own health over time,
        split by income groups. The dataset spans 2016–2023 and highlights
        health disparities based on socio-economic status.

        <h3>Analysis of Perceived Health Status Over Time</h3>
        <p>
          This line chart tracks the percentage of people in selected countries
          who report being in
          <em>“good” or “very good” health</em>, broken down by income quintile
          (Q1 = lowest 20%, Q5 = highest 20%) over multiple years.
        </p>
        <p>
          A clear trend is visible across nearly all countries: perceived health
          status dropped noticeably during the COVID-19 pandemic years
          (2020–2022). This decline affected both income groups, but
          disproportionately impacted those in the lowest quintile. The data
          highlights how health crises can widen socio-economic disparities in
          well-being, especially when systems are already under strain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparing countries reveals wide variation in both baseline health
          perception and the size of the Q1–Q5 gap. In France, for example, the
          perceived health gap widened from about 10 percentage points in 2016
          to over 21 by 2023. In contrast, New Zealand shows strong health
          ratings across both income groups, suggesting that more equitable
          healthcare and social support systems can mitigate inequality’s
          effects. Some countries, like Germany, display a relatively stable gap
          with minor variation across the observed years.
        </p>
        <p>
          One striking outlier is Japan, where perceived health is significantly
          lower than other countries — even among the wealthiest quintile. This
          may be partially explained by Japan’s older population, but cultural
          differences likely also play a role. Japanese respondents may be more
          reserved or self-critical when assessing their own health, reflecting
          differing norms around self-reporting and satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Post-pandemic recovery also varies by region. In Australia and the
          United States, health perception among high-income groups returned
          quickly to near pre-pandemic levels. However, countries like Denmark
          and France saw longer-lasting declines, particularly in their
          lower-income populations. This uneven rebound underscores how
          different public health responses and economic safety nets shaped
          recovery experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the visualisation reveals how economic status, cultural
          norms, demographic makeup, and national policy all influence perceived
          health. During crises like COVID-19, these factors converge — often
          amplifying the vulnerability of already disadvantaged groups.
          Understanding these dynamics is essential for designing more equitable
          health systems going forward.
