      <h1>OECD Health Expenditure Data Exploration</h1>
      <p>
        This website presents interactive data visualisations based on OECD
        Health Statistics. The project aims to explore how different countries
        allocate public resources to healthcare, particularly hospital
        expenditure as a percentage of GDP. By examining these patterns
        alongside other health indicators in future charts, we seek to highlight
        the importance of sustained investment in public health systems for
        better outcomes and equity.

        <h3>Analysis of Hospital Expenditure by Country (2016)</h3>
        <p>
          This bar chart visualizes the
          <strong
            >percentage of GDP that 34 countries allocated to hospital services
            in 2016</strong
          >. <strong>Denmark leads</strong> the group at
          <strong>4.689%</strong>, followed closely by
          <strong>Japan, Greece, and Australia</strong>—all exceeding
          <strong>3.6%</strong>. At the other end of the scale, countries such
          as the <strong>United Kingdom (1.162%)</strong>,
          <strong>Luxembourg (1.327%)</strong>, and
          <strong>Sweden (1.342%)</strong>
          allocated relatively little to hospital expenditure.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a public health policy perspective, this distribution raises
          important questions about the
          <strong>prioritisation of healthcare within national budgets</strong>.
          While GDP percentages do not capture the full complexity of a nation’s
          health system, they do reflect
          <strong>government and system-level commitment</strong> to
          <strong>hospital infrastructure and services</strong>—a critical
          pillar of public health capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, several
          <strong
            >high-income countries with advanced healthcare systems</strong
          >
          (e.g. <strong>Germany, France, Canada</strong>) still fall below
          <strong>3.5% of GDP in hospital spending</strong>. This suggests that
          even among OECD nations,
          <strong>investment in hospital services varies considerably</strong>
          despite similar economic capacities.
        </p>
        <p>
          For researchers and policymakers advocating for
          <strong>increased public health funding</strong>, this visualisation
          serves as a <strong>compelling starting point</strong>. It highlights
          <strong>significant disparities</strong> and invites deeper
          exploration of the relationship between
          <strong>hospital spending and health outcomes</strong> (e.g. life
          expectancy, avoidable mortality, or patient satisfaction). As
          additional datasets are incorporated into this project—such as
          <strong>perceived health status</strong>,
          <strong>healthcare access equity</strong>, and
          <strong>preventative care spending</strong>—we aim to show that
          nations investing more consistently in health tend to achieve
          <strong>better public health outcomes</strong>.

        <h3>Analysis of Perceived Health Status Over Time</h3>
        <p>
          This line chart tracks the percentage of people in selected countries
          who report being in
          <em>“good” or “very good” health</em>, broken down by income quintile
          (Q1 = lowest 20%, Q5 = highest 20%) over multiple years.
        </p>
        <p>
          A clear trend is visible across almost all countries:
          <strong
            >perceived health status dropped noticeably during the COVID-19
            pandemic years (2020–2022)</strong
          >. This decline affected both lower- and higher-income groups, but
          often more sharply among those in the lowest income quintile. The data
          highlights how health crises can
          <strong>widen socio-economic disparities in well-being</strong>, even
          in high-income nations.
        </p>
        <p>
          One particularly striking case is <strong>Japan</strong>, where
          perceived health status is significantly lower than in other countries
          — for both low- and high-income groups. Even among Japan’s wealthiest
          20%, fewer than 45% report being in good or very good health in recent
          years. In contrast, high-income groups in other countries typically
          report rates between 70% and 95%. This may reflect
          <strong>Japan’s much older population</strong>, as older individuals
          may be more likely to report lower perceived health, even when
          objective health indicators like life expectancy remain high.
        </p>
        <p>
          These patterns suggest that
          <strong
            >income and age demographics both strongly influence how people
            perceive their own health</strong
          >
          — and that public health investments should consider not just clinical
          outcomes, but also how people feel about their health, especially
          during periods of crisis.

      <h2>Spending vs Health Gap</h2>
      <p>
        Comparing the two charts—<strong
          >hospital expenditure as a percentage of GDP</strong
        >
        and <strong>perceived health status by income group</strong>—reveals
        notable trends and disparities.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, <strong>Sweden</strong> spent just
        <strong>1.34% of GDP on hospitals</strong> in 2016, significantly lower
        than <strong>Norway’s 3.54%</strong>. Correspondingly, perceived health
        among Sweden’s lowest income group (Q1) was <strong>63.6%</strong>,
        compared to <strong>69%</strong> in Norway—suggesting that higher
        hospital investment may correlate with better perceived health among
        disadvantaged groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, <strong>Denmark</strong> had the
        <strong>highest hospital expenditure</strong> at
        <strong>4.69% of GDP</strong>, yet its Q1 perceived health score was
        only <strong>66.0%</strong>. This might reflect higher national health
        awareness or investment in response to existing health burdens, rather
        than purely resulting in better outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A stark contrast is visible in the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>,
        where hospital expenditure was just <strong>1.16% of GDP</strong>, and
        Q1 perceived health was relatively low at <strong>59.6%</strong>. On the
        other hand, <strong>Australia</strong> spent <strong>3.65%</strong> of
        GDP and saw a much higher Q1 perceived health score of
        <strong>84.1%</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One notable outlier is <strong>Japan</strong>, which had the
        <strong>second-highest hospital spending</strong> at
        <strong>3.72% of GDP</strong>, yet reported the
        <strong>lowest perceived health status</strong>: only
        <strong>28%</strong> in Q1 and <strong>39.4%</strong> even in the
        wealthiest quintile (Q5). This may be influenced by Japan’s aging
        population, which likely impacts self-reported health perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, while
        <strong>higher spending on hospital services</strong> appears to support
        better perceived health—especially for lower-income groups—exceptions
        like Japan and Denmark suggest that
        <strong>other demographic or cultural factors</strong> (e.g. aging,
        awareness, expectations, or perhaps even climate) also shape how health
        is perceived.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data note:</strong> All Q1 perceived health values referenced
        are from <strong>2016</strong>, except for <strong>Australia</strong>,
        which uses <strong>2017</strong> data due to lack of availability in
        2016.

      <h2>About This Prototype</h2>
      <p>
        This project represents a <strong>working prototype</strong> built to
        practice the complete process of data-driven visualisation—from
        <strong>data collection and cleaning</strong> to
        <strong>JSON transformation</strong> and
        <strong>D3.js implementation</strong>. Rather than aiming for a final
        polished product at this stage, the current version serves as a testbed
        to trial ideas, refine our workflows, and experiment with interactivity
        and formatting.
      </p>

      <p>Key features implemented in this prototype include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Animated bar chart</strong> for hospital expenditure (% of
          GDP), with each bar growing on page load.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tooltip on hover</strong> for both bar and line charts,
          providing precise values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Country dropdown menu</strong> for the line chart, allowing
          user-driven comparison across nations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clean code structure</strong> with functions split by
          responsibility (e.g., axes rendering, line drawing, tooltips),
          following <em>clean code principles</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistent styling and layout</strong> across charts, using
          reusable margins and scales.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data preprocessing pipeline</strong> using Python to extract
          and structure raw OECD data into clean JSON.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The final version of this project will include
        <strong>additional visualisations</strong>,
        <strong>more nuanced comparisons</strong> and an
        <strong>integrated narrative</strong> that clearly argues the case for
        increased health investment using both data and storytelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        For now, this prototype demonstrates a working foundation—both
        technically and analytically—for what will become a more complex and
        polished interactive report.
