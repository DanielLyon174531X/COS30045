      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        This project presents an interactive visual analysis of international
        public health trends using data visualisations built with D3.js. Drawing
        on official datasets from the OECD Data Explorer, we explore the
        relationship between national health spending and how citizens perceive
        their own health.
      </p>

      <p>
        The aim of this site is to turn raw data into insight. Through a series
        of visualisations, we highlight disparities between financial investment
        in healthcare and reported wellbeing — revealing how economic priorities
        may (or may not) align with public health outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>The site is organised into three core sections:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>
            <a href="health-expenditure.html">Health Expenditure:</a></strong
          >
          Country-level spending on hospital services as a percentage of GDP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            ><a href="perceived-health.html"
              >Perceived Health Status:</a
            ></strong
          >
          Self-reported health by income quintile over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="cross-analysis.html">Cross-Analysis:</a></strong>
          Bringing both datasets together to uncover patterns and raise critical
          questions about health equity and investment effectiveness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="conclusion.html">Project Conclusion:</a></strong>
          Final reflections on the project’s goals, development process,
          challenges, and key lessons learned while building the visualisation
          prototype.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is the final version of the website, created as part of a
        university project for COS30045 - Data Visualisation at Swinburne
        University. Our goal was not just technical implementation, but to
        develop a coherent narrative through data — using interactivity, design,
        and evidence to support informed discussion about public health policy.
