      <h1>OECD Health Expenditure Data Exploration</h1>
      <p>
        This website presents interactive data visualisations based on OECD
        Health Statistics. The project aims to explore how different countries
        allocate public resources to healthcare, particularly hospital
        expenditure as a percentage of GDP. By examining these patterns
        alongside other health indicators in future charts, we seek to highlight
        the importance of sustained investment in public health systems for
        better outcomes and equity.

        <h3>Chart Analysis: Hospital Expenditure as % of GDP (2016)</h3>
        <p>
          This bar chart visualizes the percentage of GDP that 34 countries
          allocated to hospital services in 2016. Denmark leads the group at
          4.689%, followed closely by Japan, Greece, and Australia—all exceeding
          3.6%. At the other end of the scale, countries such as the United
          Kingdom (1.162%), Luxembourg (1.327%), and Sweden (1.342%) allocated
          relatively little to hospital expenditure.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a public health policy perspective, this distribution raises
          important questions about the prioritisation of healthcare within
          national budgets. While GDP percentages do not capture the full
          complexity of a nation’s health system, they do reflect government and
          system-level commitment to hospital infrastructure and services—a
          critical pillar of public health capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, several high-income countries with advanced healthcare
          systems (e.g. Germany, France, Canada) still fall below 3.5% of GDP in
          hospital spending. This suggests that even among OECD nations,
          investment in hospital services varies considerably despite similar
          economic capacities.
        </p>
        <p>
          For researchers and policymakers advocating for increased public
          health funding, this visualisation serves as a compelling starting
          point. It highlights significant disparities and invites deeper
          exploration of the relationship between hospital spending and health
          outcomes (e.g. life expectancy, avoidable mortality, or patient
          satisfaction). As additional datasets are incorporated into this
          project—such as perceived health status, healthcare access equity, and
          preventative care spending—we aim to show that nations investing more
          consistently in health tend to achieve better public health outcomes.

          <strong>Data note:</strong> Israel was excluded from the visualisation
          due to its exceptionally low value (~0.218%), which resulted in a bar
          too small to display effectively within the chart's dimensions. The
          data remains available in the original dataset.
