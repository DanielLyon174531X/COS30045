      <h1>Cross-Analysis: Spending vs. Health Perception</h1>

      <p>
        This section combines insights from the previous two datasets to
        investigate whether increased health expenditure corresponds to better
        perceived health among citizens — and whether that effect is equally
        distributed across income groups.

      <h2>Spending vs Health Gap</h2>
      <p>
        Comparing the two charts—<strong
          >hospital expenditure as a percentage of GDP</strong
        >
        and <strong>perceived health status by income group</strong>—reveals
        notable trends and disparities.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, <strong>Sweden</strong> spent just
        <strong>1.34% of GDP on hospitals</strong> in 2016, significantly lower
        than <strong>Norway’s 3.54%</strong>. Correspondingly, perceived health
        among Sweden’s lowest income group (Q1) was <strong>63.6%</strong>,
        compared to <strong>69%</strong> in Norway—suggesting that higher
        hospital investment may correlate with better perceived health among
        disadvantaged groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, <strong>Denmark</strong> had the
        <strong>highest hospital expenditure</strong> at
        <strong>4.69% of GDP</strong>, yet its Q1 perceived health score was
        only <strong>66.0%</strong>. This might reflect higher national health
        awareness or investment in response to existing health burdens, rather
        than purely resulting in better outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A stark contrast is visible in the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>,
        where hospital expenditure was just <strong>1.16% of GDP</strong>, and
        Q1 perceived health was relatively low at <strong>59.6%</strong>. On the
        other hand, <strong>Australia</strong> spent <strong>3.65%</strong> of
        GDP and saw a much higher Q1 perceived health score of
        <strong>84.1%</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One notable outlier is <strong>Japan</strong>, which had the
        <strong>second-highest hospital spending</strong> at
        <strong>3.72% of GDP</strong>, yet reported the
        <strong>lowest perceived health status</strong>: only
        <strong>28%</strong> in Q1 and <strong>39.4%</strong> even in the
        wealthiest quintile (Q5). This may be influenced by Japan’s aging
        population, which likely impacts self-reported health perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, while
        <strong>higher spending on hospital services</strong> appears to support
        better perceived health—especially for lower-income groups—exceptions
        like Japan and Denmark suggest that
        <strong>other demographic or cultural factors</strong> (e.g. aging,
        awareness, expectations, or perhaps even climate) also shape how health
        is perceived.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data note:</strong> All Q1 perceived health values referenced
        are from <strong>2016</strong>, except for <strong>Australia</strong>,
        which uses <strong>2017</strong> data due to lack of availability in
        2016.

      <h2>2. Health Expenditure vs. Q1 Self-Reported Health</h2>

        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 2.</strong> Relationship between hospital expenditure

      <div class="analysis">
        <p>
          This chart presents a more complex and uneven relationship. While some
          high-spending countries (e.g. Norway, France) achieve reasonably good
          Q1 health outcomes, others (e.g. Denmark) report much lower perceived
          health among poorer citizens despite high investment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The variability suggests that spending alone does not guarantee
          equitable health outcomes for low-income groups. Social determinants,
          accessibility, and targeted policy interventions likely play a
          stronger role in shaping the wellbeing of Q1 populations. This
          visualisation reinforces the importance of equity-oriented health
          investment.

      <h2>1. Health Expenditure vs. Q5 Self-Reported Health</h2>
      <figure>
        <div id="scatter-q5"></div>
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Relationship between hospital expenditure
          (% of GDP) and perceived health status among the wealthiest income
          quintile (Q5), by country (2016–2022 average where available).

      </figure>
      <div class="analysis">
        <p>
          This scatterplot reveals a modest positive correlation between
          national health expenditure and self-reported health among the
          wealthiest (Q5). Countries like the United States and Canada show both
          high spending and high perceived health, while lower-spending
          countries like Poland and Hungary show slightly lower health ratings
          among Q5 citizens.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the relationship is not perfectly linear. Some countries
          achieve relatively high Q5 health ratings despite modest spending
          (e.g. Australia), suggesting that other factors — such as healthcare
          efficiency, lifestyle, or private sector access — may influence
          outcomes in higher-income groups.

      <h2>3. Health Expenditure vs. Health Perception Gap (Q5 − Q1)</h2>
      <figure>
        <div id="scatter-gap"></div>
        <figcaption>
          <strong>Figure 3.</strong> Gap in perceived health status between the
          wealthiest (Q5) and poorest (Q1) citizens versus hospital expenditure
          (% of GDP), by country.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <div class="analysis">
        <p>
          This scatterplot highlights disparities in health perception by income
          group. A larger gap (Q5 − Q1) indicates greater inequality in
          self-reported health. Interestingly, some of the highest-spending
          countries (e.g. Denmark and the US) exhibit the largest perception
          gaps, while others with moderate spending (e.g. France, Germany)
          maintain more equitable outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This trend raises critical questions about how healthcare budgets are
          allocated. High national expenditure does not necessarily reduce
          disparities. In fact, without equity-focused strategies, increased
          funding may disproportionately benefit wealthier populations.

      <h2>Overall Insight</h2>
      <p>
        Together, these scatterplots demonstrate that spending alone is not a
        sufficient predictor of either national health outcomes or equity. While
        high investment can contribute to improved wellbeing — especially among
        wealthier citizens — the benefits do not automatically extend to all
        income groups. Policy design, access, and inclusivity remain crucial
        factors in achieving fair and effective healthcare systems.
