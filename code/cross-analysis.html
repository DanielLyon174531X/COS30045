      <h1>Cross-Analysis: Spending vs. Health Perception</h1>
      <p>
        This section combines insights from previous datasets to investigate
        whether increased hospital expenditure aligns with better health
        outcomes – particularly for lower-income groups.
      </p>

      <h2>Spending vs Health Gap</h2>
      <p>
        Comparing the previous sections — hospital expenditure as a percentage
        of GDP and perceived health status by income group—reveals notable
        trends and disparities.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, Sweden spent just 1.34% of GDP on hospitals in 2016,
        significantly lower than Norway’s 3.54%. Correspondingly, perceived
        health among Sweden’s lowest income group (Q1) was 63.6%, compared to
        69% in Norway—suggesting that higher hospital investment may correlate
        with better perceived health among disadvantaged groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, Denmark had the highest hospital expenditure at 4.69% of
        GDP, yet its Q1 perceived health score was only 66.0%. This might
        reflect higher national health awareness or investment in response to
        existing health burdens, rather than purely resulting in better
        outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A stark contrast is visible in the United Kingdom, where hospital
        expenditure was just 1.16% of GDP, and Q1 perceived health was
        relatively low at 59.6%. On the other hand, Australia spent 3.65% of GDP
        and saw a much higher Q1 perceived health score of 84.1%.
      </p>
      <p>
        One notable outlier is Japan, which had the second-highest hospital
        spending at 3.72% of GDP, yet reported the lowest perceived health
        status: only 28% in Q1 and 39.4% even in the wealthiest quintile (Q5).
        This may be influenced by Japan’s aging population, which likely impacts
        self-reported health perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, while higher spending on hospital services appears to support
        better perceived health—especially for lower-income groups—exceptions
        like Japan and Denmark suggest that other demographic or cultural
        factors (e.g. aging, awareness, expectations, or perhaps even climate)
        also shape how health is perceived.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data note: All Q1 perceived health values referenced are from 2016,
        except for Australia, which uses 2017 data due to lack of availability
        in 2016.

      <div class="analysis">
        <p>
          This chart presents a more complex and uneven relationship. While some
          high-spending countries (e.g. Norway, France) achieve reasonably good
          Q1 health outcomes, others (e.g. Denmark) report much lower perceived
          health among poorer citizens despite high investment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The variability suggests that spending alone does not guarantee
          equitable health outcomes for low-income groups. Social determinants,
          accessibility, and targeted policy interventions likely play a
          stronger role in shaping the wellbeing of Q1 populations. This
          visualisation reinforces the importance of equity-oriented health
          investment.

      <h2>2. Health Expenditure vs. Q5 Self-Reported Health</h2>

        <div id="scatter-q5" class="responsive-chart"></div>

      </figure>
      <div class="analysis">
        <p>
          This scatterplot reveals a modest positive correlation between
          national health expenditure and self-reported health among the
          wealthiest (Q5). Countries like Canada and Norway show both high
          spending and high perceived health, while lower-spending countries
          like the UK and Sweden show slightly lower Q5 health ratings.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the relationship is not perfectly linear. Some countries
          achieve relatively high Q5 health ratings despite modest spending
          (e.g. Australia), suggesting that other factors — such as healthcare
          efficiency, lifestyle, or private sector access — may influence
          outcomes in higher-income groups.

      <div class="analysis">
        <p>
          This scatterplot highlights disparities in health perception by income
          group. A larger gap (Q5 − Q1) indicates greater inequality in
          self-reported health. Interestingly, some of the highest-spending
          countries (e.g. Denmark and Germany) exhibit the largest perception
          gaps, while others with moderate spending (e.g. France, Australia)
          maintain more equitable outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This trend raises critical questions about how healthcare budgets are
          allocated. High national expenditure does not necessarily reduce
          disparities. In fact, without equity-focused strategies, increased
          funding may disproportionately benefit wealthier populations.

      <h2>Overall Insight</h2>
      <p>
        Together, these scatterplots demonstrate that spending alone is not a
        sufficient predictor of either national health outcomes or equity. While
        high investment can contribute to improved wellbeing — especially among
        wealthier citizens — the benefits do not automatically extend to all
        income groups. Policy design, access, and inclusivity remain crucial
        factors in achieving fair and effective healthcare systems.
