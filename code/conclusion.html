        <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          This project set out to explore international public health trends
          using interactive, data-driven visualisations. Our primary aim was to
          examine how different nations invest in hospital services, and how
          those investments might relate to people’s self-reported health —
          particularly across income groups.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the course of development, we implemented a full pipeline from
          data sourcing and cleaning to JSON transformation and interactive
          chart design using D3.js. The visualisations allow for user
          interaction, comparisons across time and countries, and encourage
          evidence-based reflection on public health spending.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along the way, we encountered some challenges. Coordinating group
          contributions proved difficult, and all design and technical tasks
          were managed independently. However, this also offered a valuable
          opportunity to gain confidence in a range of front-end and
          data-processing skills — including HTML, CSS, JavaScript (D3), and
          Python for data cleaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the key lessons from this project is the importance of
          narrative structure in data visualisation. Building engaging,
          interactive tools is only half the story — users also need clear,
          contextual interpretation to understand what the data shows and why it
          matters. We also learned the value of consistent code structure and
          reusable components, especially when working across multiple datasets
          and chart types.
        </p>

        <p>
          While this website demonstrates a solid foundation in interactive data
          visualisation, it is not as complex or feature-complete as originally
          envisioned. Due to time constraints and an uneven distribution of
          workload, several planned enhancements — including additional
          datasets, interactive filters, and advanced styling — were not fully
          implemented. However, this too was a valuable aspect of the learning
          process. Projects often encounter challenges in collaboration, timing,
          and scope, and adapting to those realities is part of developing both
          technical and project management skills. Despite the limitations, this
          experience has provided meaningful insight into the end-to-end process
          of building and communicating with data.

        <h2>Features Implemented</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Animated bar chart</strong> for hospital expenditure (% of
            GDP), with smooth transitions on year change and a timeline scrubber
            with play/pause control.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interactive line chart</strong> with country selector and
            brushing functionality, allowing users to zoom into custom year
            ranges and inspect trends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Average trend line chart</strong> displaying hospital
            spending across OECD countries, with COVID-19 years visually
            highlighted for context.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scatterplots with responsive tooltips</strong> comparing
            hospital spending to perceived health for both Q1 and Q5 income
            groups, plus a third plot showing inequality gap (Q5 − Q1).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tooltip on hover</strong> for all charts (bars, lines, and
            scatter), showing exact values and country names to improve
            interpretability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Responsive layout and scaling</strong> across all
            visualisations, including mobile support via viewBox-based SVG
            sizing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Accessibility improvements</strong>, including
            <code>role="img"</code> and <code>aria-label</code> on SVG elements
            for screen reader compatibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clean code structure</strong> with modular D3.js files per
            chart, grouped helper functions, and consistent naming conventions
            following clean code principles.
